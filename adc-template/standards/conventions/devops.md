# DevOps Workflow Policy

## Branching and Check-In Rules
- **No Direct Check-In to `main`**: Direct commits or direct pushes to the `main` branch are forbidden.
- **Required Development Branch**: All code check-ins MUST be performed on a dedicated development branch named `dev/<scope>` (or `dev/<scope>-<ticket>`).
- **Merge Path**: Changes MUST be merged into `main` only through a reviewed Pull Request.
- **Pre-Merge Gates**: Required CI checks and policy checklist validation MUST pass before merge.
- **Hotfix Exception**: Emergency hotfixes may use `hotfix/<scope>` branches, but direct commits to `main` are still forbidden.

## Deploy Key Handling Policy
- **Documentation Location**: The active public deploy key MUST be recorded in `docs/deploy_key.md`.
- **Preferred Source**: Reuse an existing approved public deploy key when available.
- **Fallback Generation**: If no approved deploy key exists, generate a new SSH key pair without passphrase and record the public key in `docs/deploy_key.md`.
- **No Private Key in Repo**: Private keys MUST NEVER be committed to the repository.
- **Rotation Update**: When deploy keys rotate, `docs/deploy_key.md` MUST be updated in the same change set.
